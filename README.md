A simple PHP library to connect to Anthropic APIs (Claude).

I created this package to fulfull my own needs on my AI projects. I am aware that there are other similar packages, but either they didn't have all the required features or I just didn't like the implementation and usage.

### Features
* Completion API (legacy)
* Messages API
* Support multi-content messages (Vision)
* Tool usage (beta)

#### Roadmap
* Streaming

### Installation
`composer require nunodonato/anthropic-php`

### Usage
coming soon
